#Currency map

This website helps you to choose you next holiday destination.

##Instructions

- First select a country. 

- We calculate how much a currency has been going up or down with respect to your selection in the previous months. Green means the currency is cheaper than usual, red more expensive.

- Note that we are not calculating the absolute cost of the currency relative to your selected country!

## Stretch goals

You can toggle 'select mode' to select a group of countries. We are planning a feature that will enable the range of scores to be recalibrated after selection to map across only the countries selected.
