#Currency map

This website helps you to choose you next holiday destination.

##Instructions

- First select a country. 

- We calculate how much a currency has been going up or down with respect to your selection in the previous months. Green means the currency is cheaper than usual, red more expensive.

- NOTE that we are not calculating the absolute cost of the currency relative to your selected country! The colours denote movements up and down of each currency's price with respect to its own historical values...It is these values that are relative to the selected country, not the final score.

## Stretch goals

You can toggle 'select mode' to select a group of countries. We are planning a feature that will enable the range of scores to be recalibrated after selection to map across only the countries selected.
